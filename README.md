# aas-apis
This repository collects the official AAS OpenApi definitions and serves as a vehicle to present a SAP flavour to the community.

It is **not** the official or normative source for either the IDTA AAS API definitions nor the SAP implemented ones. It simply collects the core OpenApi files from [SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/search?owner=Plattform_i40) and provides a plattform to try things and discuss new features in a transparent manner.
